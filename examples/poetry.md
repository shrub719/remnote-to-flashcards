- # Poison Tree
  - I was angry with my friend:
  I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
  - I was angry with my foe: 
  I told it not, my wrath did grow.
  - And I water’d it in fears,
  Night and morning with my tears;
  - And I sunned it with smiles,
  And with soft deceitful wiles.
  - In the morning glad I see
  My foe outstretch'd beneath the tree.
- # Sennacherib
  - The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
  And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
  - And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
  When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
  - Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
  That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
  - Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown, 
  That host on the morrow lay wither'd and strown.
  - Angel of Death
  - And breathed in the face of the foe as he pass'd;
  - The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.
  - And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,
  - And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
  Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!
- # Prelude
  - It was an act of stealth
  And troubled pleasure,
  - She was an elfin pinnace; lustily
  I dipped my oars into the silent lake,
  - a huge peak, black ang huge,
  As if with voluntary power instinct,
  Upreared its head.
  - o'er my thoughts
  There hung a darkness, call it solitude
  - huge and mighty forms, that do not live
  Like living men,
- # Man He Killed
  - We should have sat us down to wet
  Right many a nipperkin!
  - I shot at him as he at me,
  And killed him in his place
  - I shot him dead because ‒
  Because he was my foe,
  Just so: my foe of course he was;
  That's clear enough; although
  - He thought he'd 'list perhaps,
  Off-hand like ‒ just as I ‒
  - quaint and curious war is!
- # Cousin Kate
  - Why did a great lord find me out
  And praise my flaxen hair?
  - He lured me to his palace-home ‒ 
  Woe's me for joy thereof ‒
  - To lead a shameless shameful life,
  His plaything and his love.
  - He wore me like a golkden knot,
  He changed me like a glove:
  - So now I moan an unclean thin
  Who might have been a dove.
  - O Lady Kate, my Cousin Kate,
  You grow more fair than I:
  - Chose you and cast me by.
  - He bound you with his ring:
  - The neighbours call you good and pure,
  Call me an outcast thing.
  - O Cousin Kate, my love was true,
  Your love was writ in sand:
  - Yet I've a gift you have not got
  And seem not like to get:
  - My fair-haired son, my shame, my pride,
  Cling closer, closer yet:
- # Exposure
  - But nothing happens.
  - Sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence.
  Less deadly than the air that shudders black with snow,
  - Pale flakes with fingering stealth come feeling for our faces ‒
  - Is it that we are dying?
  - For God's invincible spring our love is made afraid;
  - For love of God seems dying.
  - Tonight, His frost will fasten on this mud and us,
  - Pause over half-known faces. All their eyes are ice.
- # Charge
  - Half a league, half a league,
  Half a league onward,
  All in the valley of Death
  Rode the six hundred.
  - Into the valley of Death
  Rode the six hundred.
  - Their's not to make reply,
  Their's not to reason why,
  Their's but to do and die:
  - Cannon to right of them,
  Cannon to left of them,
  Cannon in front of them
  Volley'd and thunder'd;
  - Into the jaws of Death,
  Into the mouth of Hell
  Rode the six hundred.
  - Charging an army, while
  All the world wonder'd:
  - Storm'd at with shot and shell,
  While horse and hero fell,
  - Honour the charge they made!
  Honour the Light Brigade,
  Noble six hundred!
- # Catrin
  - I can remember you, child,
  - the tight
  Red rope of love which we both
  Fought over.
  - We want, we shouted,
  To be two, to be ourselves.
  - bringing up
  From the heart's pool that old rope,
  Tightening about my life,
  Trailing love and conflict,
- # War Photographer
  - The reasurrance of the frame is flexible
  ‒ you can think that just outside it
  people eat, sleep, love normally
  while I seek out the tragic, the absurd,
  to make a subject.
  - Or if the picture's such as lifts the heart
  the firmess of the edges can convince you
  this is how things are
  - she dropped her burden
  and, mouth to small for her dark scream,
  began to run...
  - 'Even in hell the human spirit
  triumphs over all'.
  - But hell, like heaven, is untidy
  its boundaries
  arbitrary as a blood stain on a wall.
- # Belfast Confetti
  - And the explosion.
  Itself - an asterisk on the map. This hyphenated line, a burst of rapid fire...
  - A Saracen, Kremlin-2 mesh. Makrolon face-shields. Walkie-talkies. What is
  My name? Where am I coming from? Where am I going? A fusillade of question-marks.
- # Class Game
  - How can you tell what class I'm from?
  I can talk posh like some
  With an 'Olly in me mouth
  Down me nose, wear an 'at not a scarf
  With me second-hand clothes.
  - Or did I drop my unemployment card
  Sitting on your patio (We have a yard)?
  - Have I a label on me head, and another on me bum?
  - Why do you care what class I'm from?
  Does it stick in your gullet like a sour plum?
  - Well, mate! A cleaner is me mother
  A docker is me brother
  Bread pudding is wet nelly
  And me stomach is me belly
  And I'm proud of the class that I come from.
- # Poppies
  - crimped petals,
  spams of paper red disrupting a blockade
  of yellow bias binding around your blazer.
  - All my words
  flattened, rolled, turned into felt,
  slowly melting.
  - After you'd gone I went into your bedroom, 
  released a song bird from its cage.
  - The dove pulled freely against the sky,
  an ornamental stitch.
- # No Problem
  - I am not de problem
  But i bear de brunt
  Of silly playground taunts
  An racist stunts,
  - I am not de problem
  I am born academic
  But dey got me on de run
  Now I am branded athletic
  - Yu put me in a pigeon hole
  But I am versatile
  - Black is not de problem
  Mother country get it right
  An juss fe de record,
  Sum of me best friends are white.
